# The most greatest and legendary website repo of all time

This is a repo. For a website. Made using sakura:

### [sakura](https://org/projects/sakura): a minimal ***classless*** css *framework* / **theme**.

> The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life

Just drop in `sakura.css` to any webpage and go from
ugly looking 1900's website to a pretty modern website
in literally 0 seconds.

Easy to customize and build on top of sakura.
