	        Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit are lousy. Therefore, I decided to create a small site on my own to document stuff I discover or worked on. 
	      </p>

	      <p>
		I will try to document things that really, in my opinion, need documenting. Everyting needs documenting, therefore this website will have a bunch of different articles relating to a bunch of unrelated things that peak my scattered short term interest at any one time.
              </p>

	      <p>
	        I don't have a good memory and get bored and lose interest in things easily for long periods of time. Therefore, expect me to write a lot about absolutely everything. The information you find in this blog is of the highest value, and definitely is not suspect in any way, shape, or form. You can definitely trust anything I write here.

	        Did you know that this website does not contain any useless, superfluous, dumb, asinine, idiotic js? I know, right? No js in the year of our Lord 2022? This site is like an oasis in the sahara of filler content that the web has become. I have amazingly pimped out this website only using HTML and CSS.
